Nicole is a program that searches for lyrics and writes them into the
mp3-tag of a file.

.SS Files
Nicole supports FLAC and mp3 files.
Other files can not be edited (as of now).
Files that do not have a .flac or .mp3 extension are skipped
automatically.
.PP
\f[B]mp3\f[R]: lyrics are stored in \[lq]USLT\[rq] tag as
\[lq]lyrics-\[rq]
.PP
\f[B]flac\f[R]: lyrics are stored as vorbis-comment with key
\[lq]LYRICS\[rq]
.SS History
Nicole creates a history of all files that were processed in
\f[CR]\[ti]/.configs/nicole\f[R].
If a file is in the history, it will be skipped (unless \f[CR]-i\f[R] is
passed).
If the lyrics for a file can not be obtained, it is added to
\f[CR]\[ti]/.configs/nicole/failed_files\f[R].
Those files are not skipped, the file only exists so that you can see
which lyrics were not downloaded.
.PP
If you don\[cq]t want your files in the history, add the \f[CR]-n\f[R]
option.
.SS genius
Nicole searches for lyrics using the genius api with the \[lq]title\[rq]
and \[lq]artist\[rq] tags of the file.
If the title and artist names from genius are similar enough to the ones
of the file, the lyrics are scraped from the url obtained through the
api.
.SS azlyrics
Nicole creates an azlyrics.com url from the \[lq]title\[rq] and
\[lq]artist\[rq] tags of the file.
The lyrics are extracted from the html document using regex.
.PP
Unfortunately, there needs to be a 5 second delay between each request
to azlyrics.com because the site will block your ip for a while if you
send many requests.
