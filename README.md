# Nicole - Lyrics Scraper
**N**ew-**I**ntrepid-**C**hief-**O**f-**L**yrics-**E**mbedders (obviously)

## Overview
Nicole is a program that searches for lyrics and writes them into the mp3-tag of a file.

### Files
Nicole supports FLAC and mp3 files. Other files can not be edited (as of now).
Files that do not have a .flac or .mp3 extension are skipped automatically.
- mp3: lyrics are stored in "USLT" tag as "lyrics-   "
- flac: lyrics are stored as vorbis-comment with key "LYRICS"

### History
Nicole creates a history of all files that were processed in `~/.configs/nicole`.
If a file is in the history, it will be skipped (unless `-i` is passed).
If the lyrics for a file can not be obtained, it is added to `~/.configs/nicole/failed_files`.
Those files are not skipped, the file only exists so that you can see which lyrics were not downloaded.

If you don't want your files in the history, add the `-n` option.

### genius
Nicole searches for lyrics using the genius api using the "title" and "artist" tags of the file.
If the title and artist names from genius and the tags are similar, the lyrics are scraped from the url obtained through the api.

### azlyrics
Nicole creates an azlyrics.com url from the "title" and "artist" tags of the file.
The lyrics are extracted from the html document using regex.

Unfortunately, there needs to be a 5 second delay between each request to azlyrics.com because the site will block your ip for a while if you send many requests.

### Important Note
Since the lyrics are extracted from html pages and not from an api, the lyrics sites might temporarily block your ip address if you send too many requests.
If that is the case, wait a few hours and try again.

## Usage

### Command line options
- `-d [directory]` process directory [directory]
- `-f [file]` process file [file]
- `-r` go through directories recursively
- `-s` silent, no command-line output
- `-i` ignore history
- `-n` do not write to history
- `-o` overwrite if the file already has lyrics
- `-t` test, do not write lyrics to file, but print to stdout
- `-h` show this
- `--rm_explicit` remove the "[Explicit]" lyrics warning from the song's title tag
- `--site [site]` only search [site] for lyrics (genius or azlyrics)

If you do not specify a directory or file, the program will ask you if you want to use the current working directory.
Example: `nicole -ior -d ~/music/artist --rm_explicit`
